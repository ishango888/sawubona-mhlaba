Today I started on my JaguarLandrover landing page. I've made one landing page before for a made up 
company(FreeCodeCamp), however, though it would be fun to attempt to recreate an existing one.I'm 
still confused on how GitHub works, but I'm getting a little understanding here and there. I used what
I learned from the GitHub tutorial to set up my second repository. Alongside working on the landing page,
my 2 other goals of mine for GitHub are to figure out a way to contribute to open source and also use 
GitHub pages.

I've now started on the CSS for the page. It was really difficult finding a good quality JLR logo photo,
but I did eventually. My wrapping in the nav-bar isn't working how I want it to work, but will figure 
something out. Overall, I'm really happy with how it's turning out at the moment. 

Still working on my JLR page replica!. I've also been learning more JS and can't wait to incorporate
everything I've learn't into  my pages. Now that I've added the right images and adjusted the fonts and 
done some CSS styling, its really starting to resemble the actual JLR Corporate website. Logging 
this project onto GitHub has been a great way to hold myself accountable to my progress. Currently been 
using CodePen but I'm going to start using Visual Studio Code in the future.

Today I made a pull request and merged my JLR initial draft branch with my main branch as I was happy with
the code I'd done so far. I'm not sure if this is exactly how your supposed to do it but, just got to experiment 
till i get it right! Ive continued myy JS learning on Codecademy( write now really getting into objects) and I'm 
I can't wait to make my pages more interavtive via JS.
