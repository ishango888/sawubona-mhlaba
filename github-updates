Today I started on my JaguarLandrover landing page. I've made one landing page before for a made up 
company(FreeCodeCamp), however, though it would be fun to attempt to recreate an existing one.I'm 
still confused on how GitHub works, but I'm getting a little understanding here and there. I used what
I learned from the GitHub tutorial to set up my second repository. Alongside working on the landing page,
my 2 other goals of mine for GitHub are to figure out a way to contribute to open source and also use 
GitHub pages.

I've now started on the CSS for the page. It was really difficult finding a good quality JLR logo photo,
but I did eventually. My wrapping in the nav-bar isn't working how I want it to work, but will figure 
something out. Overall, I'm really happy with how it's turning out at the moment.
