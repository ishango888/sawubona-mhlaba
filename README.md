Sawubona Mhlaba. My coding adventure continues!

Welcome to my first commit! As a newbie, I have so many questions: what's a pull request?,  what does "Fork" mean?, what is the "Marketplace", who is the GitHub cat?! Honestly, I'm excited:^D I wonder what I'll think when I to look back on this commit in the future, when I'm more experienced as a developer and know my way around all this stuff...There's only one way to find out!
